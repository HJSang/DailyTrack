# Sort Algorithms 
This doc is used to review and summarize sorting related algorithms.

## Selection Sort 
The selection sort algorithm sorts an array by repeatly finding the minimum elements from unsorted part and putting it at the beginning.

The algorithm maintains two subarrays in a given array.
* 1) The subarray is already sorted.
* 2) Remaining subarray which is unsorted

## Bubble Sort
 Bubble sort is the simplest sorting algorithm: Repeatly swap the adjacent elements if they are in wrong order.
